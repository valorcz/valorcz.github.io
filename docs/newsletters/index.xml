      <description>Long time, no see… It’s been a while since I shared any news from the outer world. Doesn’t necessarily mean I stopped reading or caring about the world or you, it just was a difficult year for me. But it’s time to restart this activity, hopefully with more feedback this time! :)
Before we really start, I’d like to thank Shawn McGhee and Marek Kumpost for their suggestions, corrections and help with this.</description>

      <description>“I didn’t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.”
― Mark Twain
 Good news, everyone! A new issue of my very irregular (not-so-much-about-security-now) newsletter is out!
My original idea of publishing this every quarter (or so) was clearly too optimistic, as you can see. Which leads to a huge problem &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s a load of links and texts I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you, and the length of the text could be demotivating, I know.</description>
